      A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/,[1] US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French:
      [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry
      inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
      yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and
      folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
      technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry.
