    <h1>About croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity[3] but using brioche dough.
      Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
      pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century
      when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
      yeast-leavened laminated dough.[4] In the late 1970s, the development of
      factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
      food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery,
      notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
      American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold
      in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[6]
